# Couchparty

# Description
This application allows a host to create a poll so that other users can vote on what they want to watch together.  After voting in the poll, users can interact with each other by chatting while watching the selected movie/show.   

# How to use
To host a movie night, the host will sign up (or log in) to create a poll.  Hosts can enter in as many choices as they would like- the choices will render to a poll.  Users can access the poll and vote.  Once the user has voted, they will be directed to a chat room to start chatting with their friends.  Poll results are visible in the chat room.  The host also has control of the timer in the chat room to notify everyone when to start the movie.  

# Screenshots
After the host signs in (or logs in), they will be given an option to create a poll.
