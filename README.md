# How to use
To host a movie night, the host will sign up (or log in) to create a poll.  Hosts can enter in as many choices as they would like- the choices will render to a poll.  Users can access the poll and vote.  Once the user has voted, they will be directed to a chat room to start chatting with their friends.  Poll results are visible in the chat room.  The host also has control of the timer in the chat room to notify everyone when to start the movie.  

# Screenshots
