# How to use
To host a movie night, the host will sign up (or log in) to create a poll.  Hosts can enter in as many choices as they would like- the choices will render to a poll.  Users can access the poll and vote.  Once the user has voted, they will be directed to a chat room to start chatting with their friends.  Poll results are visible in the chat room.  The host also has control of the timer in the chat room so people who enter the chat room late can see how far along the movie is.  

# Contributers
This application was developed by bpolo15, chyarbit and lhirsch1 using Google's Firebase and React Native.  The chat UI is provided by Gifted Chat.
